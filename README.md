This repo contains the implementation of a simple 4x4 Ti-Tac-Toe game written in Java. To run the unit tests, you can clone the repository on local and run the Junit tests in TicTacToeServiceTest

This implementation was done under the assumtions that:
  - For the canMove() method, you can still move even if there is a winner in the game
  - The expected behavior of the isGameOver() method is that a game is over if there is a winner and / or there are no more moves left to make
  - The given tic-tac-toe board is valid
